## CODE CHALLENGE


## Description
Complete these 3 challanges 
-Challenge 1- Student Grade Generator
-challenge 2- Speed Detector
-Challenge 3- Net Salary Calculator
## Challenge1: Student Grade Generator(Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

This program satisfies the above requirements stated above. In this program you are able to get the grade of the student based on the range of grading system.
In this program the input will be expected to be in a range of 0 to 100 otherwise you will get an alert to key in correct values.Therefore this program will neither return a value for marks below zero nor values above 100 because it will assume you have made an error.
In this program after getting your return value, a reset button is provided to start the process afresh.

## Challenge2: Speed Detector(Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

This program satifies the above requirements above. In this program we give demerit points for every 5km above the 70km which is our speed limit. In this program we have assumed the speed for fast car which is about 250 and therefore based on that assumption any values keyed in above 250 or below 0 you will immediately get an alert to enter correct value assuming you have made an error.
In this program after getting your return value, a reset button is provided to start the process afresh.

## Challenge3: Net Salary Calculator
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
