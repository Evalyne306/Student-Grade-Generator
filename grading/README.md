## Student grade generator using HTML, CSS & JavaScript



## Description
In this project, we will be using HTML to create the platform where we will key in our data ie. The subjects, the obtained marks, the parcentages and the actual values.
After creating the HTML structure, we can then create an external style sheet with CSS and link it to our existing HTML index file and format the table ie. The cell padding , margins, colors etc depending on your preference


## Project Setup
Once you are done with structure and appearance , you can add functionality to our grading generator program by using JavaScript programming language.
```js
function result(){
 // this fuction will return the value of the mean average after being divide by 500 which is the total for all the 5 subjects, then multiplied by 100 to convert our given total to percentage form
 //note that all values keyed inside the input space shoul be <= 100 otherwise you will get a promp to enter the correct values   
 //we introduce the conditional statement if .. else in order to grade the values according to the percentage acquired
 //in this case our condition is A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40
    }
    ```
